## Introduction

In this project, we are enhancing the structure and accessibility of a marketing agency website. By using Semantic HTML elements and optimizing image alt attributes, we aim to make the website more user-friendly, accessible, and search engine friendly.

## Semantic HTML

Semantic HTML tags provide meaningful structure to web content. Here are some examples of how we've incorporated Semantic HTML:

By using tags like <footer>, <article>, <header>, and <nav>, we’ve organized the content in a way that’s easy for both users and search engines to understand.

## Image Alt Attributes

Optimising image alt attributes is crucial for accessibility and SEO. All images now have descriptive alt attributes as seen in screenshot above.

These alt attributes provide context and improve accessibility for users who rely on screen readers or encounter image loading issues.

## Conclusion

By implementing Semantic HTML and optimising image alt attributes, we’ve made significant improvements to the marketing agency website’s accessibility and search engine optimization. These enhancements not only benefit users with disabilities but also increase the website’s chances of ranking higher in search engine results.
